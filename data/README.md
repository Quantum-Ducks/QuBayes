### Description of States Our Models Use:

Data for each variable was compliled from the sources above for each of the 50 US States. All variables except the last four (Age, racial demographics, poverty demographics and health demographics) were recorded for the weeks of March 22-28, April 12-18, May 10-16, and June 14-20 (all 2020).

- Stay At Home Order: 2 states. |1> = statewide stay at home order in place. |0> = no statewide stay at home order in place.

- Cases: 2 states (Lesser model). |1> = Decreasing or flat from five day average at beginning of week to five day average at end of week |0> = Increasing from five day average at beginning of week to five day average at end of week

         4 states (Mallard and Alabio models). |3> = Decreasing or flat from five day average at beginning of week to five day average at end of week. |2> = Less than 10% increase from five day average at beginning of week to five day average at end of week. |1> = 10-50% increase from five day average at beginning of week to five day average at end of week. |0> = Greater than 50% increase from five day average at beginning of week to five day average at end of week
